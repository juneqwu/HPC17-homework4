## Spring 2017: High Performance Computing 

### Assignment 4 

Problem 1: Modifications and comments are in the fixed code.

Problem 2: See plots for scalability study. When running jacobi-mpi2D, add the second and the third argument to specify the number of grid points and the number of maximum iterations.

Problem 3: Parallel sample sort. Used MPI collective communications, e.g. MPI_Alltoall, MPI_Alltoallv, MPI_Bcast. 

\*Problem 2 and Problem 3 report timing run on [STAMPEDE][https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/stampede/].
